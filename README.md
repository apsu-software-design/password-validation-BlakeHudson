# Credit

All credit goes to the University of Wisconsin for the format of this homework assignment and the survey questions below.

# Setup and Review

This repo contains code for the password validator. The below questions should be answered regarding your submission!

## Did you find the JavaScript Learning Tutor useful? If so, what about the tool made it useful? If not, why not?
> I was not aware of a JavaScript tutor.


## Do you have any suggestions on how the JavaScript Learning Tutor might be improved?
> See above.


## Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!).
> I used w3 schools, GeeksforGeeks, and nodejs.org documentation

## Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment?
> I already had a github account, and npm installed on my machine. I also have a suitable ide for node.js and TypeScript already set up so that took some time off the assignement for me. I did have difficulties with the classroom repo at first, but got those worked out. Total actual working time incuding set up, reading tutorials, and doing the coding process I would estimate 5 hours.


## On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment?
> Considering the purpose of the assignment was to become familiar with git and TypeScript, I felt the assignment was a perfect difficulty for an initial assignment with a new langauge. I have had exposure to both Githun and node.js, taking some of the learning curve out, but still found the assignment to be a 5 of 10.


## Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better?
> I Could not get gitKraken to work for the classroom repo. The command line works perfectly fine, which I wanted to get more familiar with anyway.
